Final Project - Enteroscope Biopsy Histopathological Hematoxylin and Eosin Image Dataset for Image Segmentation Tasks (EBHI-Seg)


Hello there! This was the final project from IndonesiaAI Computer Vision (CV) Bootcamp Batch 2.


We used the **EBHI-Seg Dataset** by Shi L, Li X, Hu W, Chen H, Chen J, Fan Z, Gao M, Jing Y, Lu G, Ma D, Ma Z, Meng Q, Tang D, Sun H, Grzegorzek M, Qi S, Teng Y, Li C. EBHI-Seg: A novel enteroscope biopsy histopathological hematoxylin and eosin image dataset for image segmentation tasks. Front Med (Lausanne). 2023 Jan 24;10:1114673. doi: 10.3389/fmed.2023.1114673. PMID: 36760405; PMCID: PMC9902656.

# Background

Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) → increasing trends in development and popularity.

CAD is widely used in many biomedical image analysis tasks, such as: microorganism image, COVID- 19 image, **histopathological image**, cytopathological image analysis, and etc.

Fundamental tasks of CAD : IMAGE SEGMENTATION, which can be used as key evidence in the pathologists’ diagnostic processes. Therefore each case can be accurately and efficiently examined with the help of computers.

Colon cancer is a common deadly malignant tumor, the fourth most common cancer in men, and the third most common cancer in women worldwide. 

Colon cancer is responsible for 10% of all cancer cases.

EBHI-Seg Dataset countains six classes from Colorectal cancer:

Normal - Polyp - Serrated adenoma - Low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia - High-grade intraepithelial neoplasia - Adenocarcinoma.

From the normal condition to benign and malignant stages.
